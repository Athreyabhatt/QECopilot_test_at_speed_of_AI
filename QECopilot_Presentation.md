Project: QECopilot - Test at speed of AI
Tagline: A seamless and autonomous test automation solution for the era of AI

**NEW: Framework Agnostic & LLM Flexible - Works with Your Existing Stack and Preferred AI**

1. The Problem: An AI-Fueled Speed crisis
A fundamental shift is happening right now: AI is massively accelerating software development. Developers are shipping features faster than ever before. But this new speed has created a critical, downstream crisis for Quality Engineering.

The core problem is a dangerous speed mismatch. While developer velocity skyrockets, traditional test automation—reliant on manual scripting by a small number of specialists—cannot keep pace.

This growing gap magnifies two existing, painful bottlenecks:

The Automation Skills Chasm: The desperate need for "unicorn" automation engineers becomes an impossible-to-fill fantasy. There aren't enough specialists in the world to manually script tests at the speed AI generates code.

The Process Disconnect: Rigid, manual testing processes completely shatter under the pressure of this new velocity, forcing teams to choose between slowing down innovation or sacrificing quality.

2. Our Solution: fighting Fire with Fire
The only way to match the speed and scale of AI-powered development is with AI-powered testing.

We have built an intelligent orchestrator that acts as the Quality Engineering Copilot for your entire team. It operates at machine speed, closing the gap and turning QE from a bottleneck into an accelerator.

Our agent bridges the skills gap by empowering your existing domain experts and adapts its workflow to fit your team's unique structure.

**Framework Agnostic Architecture**
QECopilot supports multiple automation frameworks and languages:
-  Playwright + TypeScript (Modern web apps, fast execution)
-  Playwright + Java (Enterprise Java projects)
-  Selenium + Java (Legacy apps, wide browser support)
-  WebdriverIO + TypeScript (Mobile testing, Node.js projects)

**Configurable LLM Providers**
QECopilot works with your preferred AI provider:
-  GitHub Copilot (Seamless GitHub integration, no API keys needed)
-  OpenAI GPT-4 (High-quality code generation, advanced reasoning)
-  Anthropic Claude (Natural language understanding, context-aware)
-  Windsurf SWE (Specialized software engineering AI, optimized for code generation)

Simply configure your preferred stack and LLM provider, and the system generates framework-specific code automatically. No vendor lock-in, no framework limitations, no AI provider restrictions.

3. Architecture: Two Workflows, One Engine
Our system offers two distinct modes of operation, powered by the same intelligent engine.
Developers and QEs work together in the same repository. QEs create feature files, and the system automatically generates and runs tests.

Result: Full validation of a deployed application, led by QE.

4. Outcome & Benefits: From Bottleneck to Booster
By automating the automation process itself, our solution delivers transformative, measurable results designed for the AI era.

 80-95% Reduction in Test Scripting Time

What took an engineer hours now takes seconds. The agent translates QE's intent into code instantly, matching the pace of AI-assisted development. Works across all supported frameworks - Playwright, Selenium, WebdriverIO.

 Accelerate Release Velocity up to 2x

By eliminating the testing bottleneck, features move from concept to production at a speed that was previously impossible.

 Find Bugs Up to 15x Cheaper

By running tests within the Pull Request, bugs are caught before they are merged. According to industry studies, a bug found in production is exponentially more expensive to fix.

 Scale Your Automation Capacity Infinitely

You are no longer limited by hiring. Your entire Quality Engineering team is now an automation powerhouse, able to create test coverage for everything development produces.

 100% QE Team Empowerment

The skills gap is eliminated. Every single QE team member can now create comprehensive feature files with their testing expertise and generate robust, maintainable automation scripts without writing a single line of code. Works with your team's preferred framework and language (TypeScript or Java).

 Framework & Provider Flexibility

No vendor lock-in. Use Playwright for speed, Selenium for compatibility, or WebdriverIO for mobile. Choose GitHub Copilot for seamless integration, OpenAI for premium quality, or Claude for natural language processing. Switch frameworks and AI providers by changing repository variables—no code changes needed.

 Repository-Based Configuration

Configure everything through GitHub's native interface—no workflow file editing required:
- **AUTOMATION_STACK**: Choose your test framework (playwright-typescript, selenium-java, etc.)
- **LLM_PROVIDER**: Select your AI model (copilot, openai, claude)
- **API Keys**: Securely store OpenAI/Anthropic credentials as repository secrets

Changes take effect immediately on the next Pull Request—no deployment needed.
